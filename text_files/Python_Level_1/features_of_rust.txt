Rust has great performance, tooling, and an active community on its side that is continuously working on language improvement. Moreover, if you need a solution with a greater focus on safety than C and C++ and you don't want to compromise on speed, Rust is a good choice for you


It is a multi-paradigm system programming language that performs C and C++ but with the design to keep the safety of the application in mind. The Rust programming language is useful as it allows the developer to write faster, more reliable software

Rust does adhere to many of the tenets of functional programming. In many cases, you can easily, naturally, and idiomatically write Rust in a functional style.
