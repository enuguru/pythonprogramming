Data mining is a process of discovering patterns 
in large data sets involving methods at the intersection 
of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. 

Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of 
computer science and statistics with an overall goal 
to extract information (with intelligent methods) 
from a data set and transform the information into a 
comprehensible structure for further use.

Data Science - Dhanurjay Patil

In 2008, Dr DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher, heads of 
analytics and data at LinkedIn and Facebook respectively, 
coined the term ‘data science’ to describe the emerging 
field of study that focused on teasing out the hidden 
value in the data that was being collected from touchpoints 
all over the retail and business sectors.
