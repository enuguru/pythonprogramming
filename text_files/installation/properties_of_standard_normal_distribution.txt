A normal distribution can be used to describe a variety of quantitative variables

A normal distribution curve is bell-shaped

The mean, median, and mode are equal and are located at the center of the distribution

A normal distribution curve is unimodal ( it has only one mode)

The curve is symmetric about the mean. It means that the right portion of the distribution is equal to the left portion of the distribution

The curve is continuous; that is, there are no gaps or holes

The curve never touches the x axis. Theoretically, no matter how far in either direction the curve extends, it never meets the x axis—but it gets increasingly closer

The total area under a normal distribution curve is equal to 1.00, or 100%

In the normal distribution, about 68% of the data fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean ; about 95% of the data fall within 2 standard deviation of the mean; and about 99.7% of data fall within 3 standard deviation of the mean
