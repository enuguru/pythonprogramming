    for the vim editor ? do the following steps to achieve this

1.  Go to file explorer
2.  Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim
3.  Select the _vimrc file
4.  Right click and go to properties and click on permissions and click on edit
5.  Click on 'Full Control' checkbox in the lower windows
6.  Click 'Apply' and click 'ok' on all the windows
7.  Now open the anaconda prompts from windows icon in the lower bottom of your
    screen
8.  Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim
9.  Type the command 'notepad _vimrc'
10. Notepad will open on your screen
11. Go to the end of the file
12. Add the following lines at the end of the file
    set nobackup
    set noswapfiles
    set noundofiles
13. Save the file and close
14. Exit the anaconda prompt and open again
15. Now you will see no backup files, swap files or undo files will be formed 

On windows, I had set nobackup in C:\Users\my-user-name\_vimrc file; but that didn't seem to work. I then added set nobackup to C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\_vimrc file. Still didn't work!

I later figured that C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\_vimrc loads a sample vimrc script from $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim and that script has this snippet:

if has("vms")
  set nobackup      " do not keep a backup file, use versions instead
else
  set backup        " keep a backup file (restore to previous version)
  if has('persistent_undo')
    set undofile    " keep an undo file (undo changes after closing)
  endif
endif
Commenting that out worked for me! So it really comes down to figuring out the order in which these scripts are getting executed, thereby overriding anything you might have done
