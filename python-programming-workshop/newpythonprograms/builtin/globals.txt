Globals. The globals() method returns all the global variables, and their values, in a dictionary. 
To display them in a program, we can first copy them into another dictionary with dict. Some hidden 
variables, like __file__ are shown.

User-defined:
The two user-defined global variables, named value1 and value2, are present as well. They have no 
surrounding underscores.
