what is a set?

set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements

A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. You can use a set instead of an array when the order of items is not important, or when you need to ensure that an item only appears once.

Sets are different in the sense that order does not matter and these will be used in cases where order does not matter


what are the uses of sets?

Basic uses include 

1. membership testing 
2. eliminating duplicate entries
3. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference


how to create a set?

you can use Curly braces { } or the set() function can be to create sets 

Note: to create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, 
a data structure that we discuss in the next section.
