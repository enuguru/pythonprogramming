# your solution is fine and works good
# just as a reference in passing i want to 
# say, there is a syntax like the one given below
# here name is the key, bankbalance is the value

# for name, bankbalance in mydict.items():
#    if bankbalance == given_balance:
#        print name

# but your solution just works fine no issues
