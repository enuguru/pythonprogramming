Make method. Namedtuple offers extra methodsâ€”one of them is _make. 
With _make() we create a namedtuple from an iterable (like a list) 
The list elements are turned into tuple fields.

Tip: The make method fills namedtuple fields based on the order 
of the list's elements. So we must be careful with ordering.
