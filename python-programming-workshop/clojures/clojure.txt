A lambda is just an anonymous function - a function defined with no name. 
In some languages, such as Scheme, they are equivalent to named functions. 
In fact, function definition is re-written as binding a lambda to a variable 
internally. In other languages, like Python, there are some (rather needless)
distinctions between them, but they behave the same way otherwise.

A closure is any function which closes over the environment in which it 
was defined. This means that it can access variables not in its parameter list.
