"Blocking" is where a thread is stuck, waiting for a something to finish so it can complete its function.

When single-threaded apps get blocked, it results in poor user experience and slower overallexecution time.

Multi-threaded apps can do more than one function "at the same time" (not really, but it 
appears that way).

While one thread is blocked, other threads can continue their execution
