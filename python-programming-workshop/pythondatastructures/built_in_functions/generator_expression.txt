For loop

Sometimes in Python programs we see loop-like statements. These are not exactly loops. 
They are generator expressions. They return an iterator. Here we multiply each element 
in the list by 2 with a generator expression.

The expression "A" for "B" in "C" uses the generator expression syntax form. The first 
part, "A," is the result expression. We can use any expression we want. The second, 
"B," is the element we are acting upon within the collection "C."

Tip: Generator expressions can be nested. This becomes hard to read. I discourage 
writing excessively complex code.

Python program that uses generator expression

# Example integers.
items = [100, 10, 1]

# Use generator expression.
multiplied = list(x * 2 for x in items)
print(multiplied)
