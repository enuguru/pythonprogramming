Is-keyword. This tests identity. Every object (like integers, classes) has an id. When 
the ids of two objects are equal, their identities too are equal. And the is-test will return True.

The operators "is" and "is not" test for object identity: "x is y" is true if and only if 
"x" and "y" are the same object.
