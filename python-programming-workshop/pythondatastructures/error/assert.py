#Assert. This statement causes an AssertionError when an expression is false. 
#We pass an expression (or value) as the first argument. Python stops and signals the assert call.

#Python that uses assert

value = 10
value2 = 100

# Assert if this expression is not true.
assert(value + value2 != 110)
