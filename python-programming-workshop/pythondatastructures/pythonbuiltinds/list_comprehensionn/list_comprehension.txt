List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the
context of the for and if clauses which follow it

The list comprehension always returns a result list
