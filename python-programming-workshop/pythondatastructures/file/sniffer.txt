Sniffer
Method

Sometimes a program may not know the format of the csv files. The delimiter characters may vary 
between files.
With Sniffer,a class,we can handle this situation. We call the sniff method to generate a dialect.

The dialect returned by sniff() is then passed to the reader initialization method. A dialect class 
stores information about the delimiter characters and how the file is formatted. We then use the reader.

Tip: If you know the file format, you can pass a string literal to sniff() without reading a sample 
of the file.
