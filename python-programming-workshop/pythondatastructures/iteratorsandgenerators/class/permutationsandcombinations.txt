Iterating Over All Possible Combinations or Permutations

Problem
You want to iterate over all of the possible combinations or permutations of a collection
of items

Solution
The itertools module provides three functions for this task. The first of these—iter
tools.permutations()—takes a collection of items and produces a sequence of tuples
that rearranges all of the items into all possible permutations 
(i.e., it shuffles them into all possible configurations)
