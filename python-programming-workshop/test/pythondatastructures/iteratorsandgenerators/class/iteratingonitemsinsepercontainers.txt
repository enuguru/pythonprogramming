Problem
You need to perform the same operation on many objects, but the objects are contained
in different containers, and you’d like to avoid nested loops without losing the

Solution
The itertools.chain() method can be used to simplify this task. It takes a list of
iterables as input, and returns an iterator that effectively masks the fact that 
you’re really acting on multiple containers. To illustrate, consider this example:
