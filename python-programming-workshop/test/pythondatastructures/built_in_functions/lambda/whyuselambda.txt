The lambdas can be used as a function shorthand that allows us to embed a 
function within the code. 

For instance, callback handlers are frequently coded as inline lambda expressions 
embedded directly in a registration call's arguments list. 

Instead of being define with a def elsewhere in a file and referenced by name, 
lambdas are also commonly used to code jump tables which are lists or dictionaries 
of actions to be performed on demand.
