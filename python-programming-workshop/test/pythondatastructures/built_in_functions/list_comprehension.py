#Create list. 

#We can use range() to create a list based on a sequence of values. This is much 
#simpler than looping and adding numbersâ€”it is shorter, less prone to bugs.

#Note: List comprehension can also be used to create lists based on expressions. 
#It is a preferred technique.

#List

#Python program that creates list from range

# Create a list from a range.
values = list(range(0, 4))
print(values)
