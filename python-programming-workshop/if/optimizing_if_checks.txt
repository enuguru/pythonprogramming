Reorder. The and-operator short-circuits. This means when a sub-expression 
evaluates to false, no further ones are evaluated. We can exploit this 
principle to improve speed.

Here:A list contains four sub-lists. In the value pairs, the first element 
differs most: there are three unique first numbers.

Value 2:This is always 1 in the pairs. It is least specific when checking 
the pairs.

So: To find pairs with both values set to 1, we should first check the 
most specific valueâ€”the first one.
