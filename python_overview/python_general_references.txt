what is the different between python library reference and python language reference ?

While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions.

The following channels provide the tutorials, talks, and session recordings from many of the smaller local Python conferences held throughout the world.

Though on their own, most of these channels do not meet the requirement for 2000 subscribers, we list them here as honorable mentions because they represent the diverse Python community throughout the world.

Note that some (maybe older) videos from these conferences are available (together with other non-Python content) on the Next Day Video and Engineers.SG channels. Alternatively, PyVideo.org can serve as a one-stop-shop where you can find most (but not all) of these session recordings.
