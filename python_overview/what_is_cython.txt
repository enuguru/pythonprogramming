What is Cython ?

The fundamental nature of Cython can be summed up as follows: Cython is Python with C data types.

Cython is Python: Almost any piece of Python code is also valid Cython code. (There are a few Limitations, but this approximation will serve for now.) The Cython compiler will convert it into C code which makes equivalent calls to the Python/C API.

But Cython is much more than that, because parameters and variables can be declared to have C data types. Code which manipulates Python values and C values can be freely intermixed, with conversions occurring automatically wherever possible. Reference count maintenance and error checking of Python operations is also automatic, and the full power of Python’s exception handling facilities, including the try-except and try-finally statements, is available to you – even in the midst of manipulating C data.
