  frequency of occurence of each element

3.Given a list of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

4.Giving a number, find the Hamming weight of it. Hamming weight is the number of 
  symbols that are different from the zero-symbol. (find the number of set bits)

5.find the parity of the given integer

6.Given an list of nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], 
  return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
